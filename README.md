# Double Lines Challenge

Algorithm that draws two lines side by side without overlapping. It must handle an arbitrary amount of points where each 3 consecutive points are forming a 90 degrees angle.

This code was developed in the context of a challenge. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/vjeux/weekly-challenge-2-double-lines).


## Requirements

* Python 
* matplotlib

## How to Run

You can both use sys.argv to enter with the points, separated by space, such as `x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn`, or follow instructions for io input.
